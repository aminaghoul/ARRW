Description: Functions to robustly estimate the parameters for the ARRW (Autoregressive AR(1) and Random Walk) 
    model for time-series. The unknown parameters of our model are the 2 variances (one for AR, one for RW) and 
    the AR(1) parameters. We also have plotting functions to better analyse our method. 
    The robust estimation is performed via the MAD estimator.
